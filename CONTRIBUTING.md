## Code of conduct
We have a code of conduct which you can read [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Issues
This is our portal for discussion. We'll be using it for most of our correspondence which includes and not limited to bug reports, feature request, and general questions about our project. We have provided a template which can be used as a guideline. Feel free to deviate when necessary. Please attach a proper label for issues so it'll be easier for everyone involved.

## Pull Requests
Feel free to directly send us a pull request for minor changes but we prefer you open up an issue before submitting a pull request. This is so we do not waste your and our time. Opening up an issue allows discussion which accelerates pull request being accepted faster too.

Our flow is as follows:

1. Open up an issue.
2. Review.
3. Accept and assign issue.
4. Create pull request.
5. Final review.
6. Merge.

Once you have been assigned to an issue, you can start working on it by:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

We have provided a template for pull request which you can use as a guideline.

## First contribution
If you're confused on where to start, you can try looking for issues with `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`. Generally bug fixes will be straight forward for first timer too. Feel free to contact us at projectwakatobi@gmail.com or straight up opening up an issue. In addition, commits does not always have to be code. If you find us making a mistake in documentation or spelling, feel free to directly issue pull request or open up an issue.
